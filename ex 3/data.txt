NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING LAB
Generally, Analysing the business match and win likelihood of prospects is time
consuming and prone to be less efficient with just relying on human analysis. Artificial 
Intelligence can help with Natural Language Processing. The project titled “Sales Engagement 
and Enrichment using Natural Language Processing” aims at providing a solution to the problem 
stated above by automating the process of engaging the customers' mails using the Natural 
Language Processing.
The objective is to build a Product called “OxoBrain”, designed to make the sales 
representative focus more on sales rather than other distracting manual tasks. Automating the 
manual tasks of a sales representative saves a lot of time and allows them to focus more on sales. 
As this is an internal product, the users of this product are the employees of the organization 
itself.
